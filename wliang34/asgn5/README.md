### Program description:
This program will implement Schmidt-Samoa (SS) Algorithm. We will first need to run keygen to generate public key and private key. In addition, we need a file to be encrypted at hand. Then you run encrypt to encrypt your file, and run decrypt when you need to decrypt.

### Quick Start
	download all the source code
	make # Running this if you need all three programs: keygen, encrypt, decrypt
    make keygen # If you need keygen
    make encrypt # If you need to encrypt a file
    make decrypt # If you need to decrypt a file

### Usage Guidance
    ./keygen -h 
    ./encrypt -h 
    ./decrypt -h
